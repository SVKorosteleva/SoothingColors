# Soothing Colors
## Story
When my daughter Anna was 2 months old, I noticed that she loves looking at our wall decoration - an RGB panel that slowly changes its color. 
And I decided that it would be a good idea to write an iOS app that does the same, so that I always have a mini version of that decoration with me - to soothe my little one or myself :)
That's how the Soothing Colors app went live.
## What it does
The app shows the screen that smooth;y changes its color:

The screen is configurable - you may tap a gear button and change the color saturation and color changung speed
## How to build
1. Clone the repo
2. Open RGBScreen.xcodeproj in Xcode
3. Click Run button

Enjoy :)
